| cpush_line_basic.s — CPUSH DC, LINE, (An) writes a dirty line back.
|
| Strategy:
|   1. Enable MMU + DTT0 covering 0x00xxxxxx as cacheable copyback,
|      ITT0 covering 0x4xxxxxxx as cacheable copyback.  Without TT
|      setup the dcache forces cache_inh=1 and CINV/CPUSH have
|      nothing to operate on.
|   2. Enable CACR.DE, then dirty a RAM line by storing V1 at addr X.
|   3. CPUSH DC, LINE, (A0=X) — writeback V1 to memory, leave line
|      valid + clean.
|   4. Dirty the SAME cache line again with V3 at addr X.
|   5. CINV DC, LINE, (A0=X) — drop V3 without writeback.
|   6. Reload addr X — must see V1 (CPUSH'd to memory).  If we saw V3,
|      CINV failed (didn't drop).  If we saw 0xFFFFFFFF, CPUSH failed
|      (didn't write back).
|
| This single test exercises both CPUSH LINE writeback and CINV LINE
| drop-without-writeback.  RAM starts at 0xFFFFFFFF per the tb mem
| model (uninit bytes).
|
| PASS: sentinel 0xC0FFEE00.
| FAIL: sentinel 0xDEADBEEF.
